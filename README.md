# node-seed
Seed project to create node project with express and mongo db

This project is an application skeleton for a typical NodeJS REST API. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your node app projects and dev environment for these projects.

## Getting Started
To get you started you can simply clone the node-seed repository and install the dependencies:

## Prerequisites
You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from http://git-scm.com/.

You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from http://nodejs.org/.

## Clone node-seed
Clone the node-seed repository using git:

git clone https://github.com/colbyjax/node-seed.git
cd node-seed
If you just want to start a new project without the node-seed commit history then you can do:

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/colbyjax/node-seed.git <your-project-name>
The depth=1 tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

##Install Dependencies

npm install

node_modules - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

Run the Application
We have preconfigured the project with a simple rest api. The simplest way to start this server is:

npm start
Now browse to the app at http://localhost:4000/api/test
